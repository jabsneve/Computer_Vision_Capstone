One of the most attractive and popular fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning today is computer vision. Computer vision entails the training of computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images and deep learning models, computers can identify, classify, and react to what they see.

Computer vision is used in many facets of todayâ€™s world from simple tasks we take for granted such as facial recognition to open our smart phones to life saving tumor recognition software that aids in the recognition of cancerous cells in patients.

# Data

I will be using the Street View Housing Numbers (SVHN) Dataset. This dataset is a collection of over 600,000 images of house numbers collected from Google Street View images and is popular for training models due to the numbers being in natural sceneries. The dataset is available in two formats: original images with character bounding boxes and cropped digits that have been resized to a fixed resolution of 32 x 32 pixels. My first, single digit, model utilizes the cropped images and the second, multi digit, model utilizes the original images.
